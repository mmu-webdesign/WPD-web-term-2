# RWD - Week One

## Developing content for your portfolio

During the Spring Term you will be developing a 'responsive' portfolio web site for assignment two. The content for this site will be developed and assessed under the Digital Asset Creation unit. 
The quality of any website is reflective on the owner. You are not only being judged on your coding, design, accessibility and usability (Web Page Development) but also on the quality of the text and media (Digital Asset Creation).

[Heidi Cohen](https://twitter.com/heidicohen) describes content as:

>“High quality, useful information that conveys a story presented in a contextually relevant manner with the goal of soliciting an emotion or engagement. Delivered live or asynchronously, content can be expressed using a variety of formats including text, images, video, audio, and/or presentations.”

Well written content and high quality media is essential for the success of your portfolio.

The Digital Asset Creation assessment brief defines the content as follows:

* a Production Summary Report (700 word, +/- 10%)
* a 4.5 minute audio documentary (900 word equivalence, +/- 10%) 
* a 4.5 minute video documentary (900 word equivalence, +/- 10%)
* a written narrative (500 words +/- 10%) 
* and to present these along with 6 photographic images (from Element 2)

This breaks down into the following sections of your portfolio:

### Introduction
* a written narrative (500 words +/- 10%) 

### Video
* a 4.5 minute video documentary (900 word equivalence, +/- 10%)
* a Production Summary Report (700 word, +/- 10%)

### Audio
* a 4.5 minute audio documentary (900 word equivalence, +/- 10%) 

### Photography gallery
* 6 photographic images (from Element 2)

You may want to include links to your social media feeds if you have them.


## Images for the gallery

- Using the six images from the first DAC assignment.
- If they can all be the same orientation (landscape or portrait) it does make things simpler, but is not essential. 
- The images can later be sized appropriately and optimized for the web when you know more about the layout you are creating.
- **You will require a 7th original image for your 'big banner', often known as the 'hero' image**. This is going to be used at a much larger size. It needs to be high quality. It should be landscape. You may chose to use a short video instead.
- Remember to keep the full size original images - always edit copies.
